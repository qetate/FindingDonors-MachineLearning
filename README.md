# Finding Donors (Supervised Learning)

## Overview
This machine learning project involves evaluating and optimizing various algorithms to predict whether individuals make more than $50,000 based on census data. The project covers model selection, performance evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis to identify the best model and improve its performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python#**: Programming language used for coding and running the machine learning models and analyses.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Tested and evaluated models including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors using metrics such as accuracy and F-score.
- **Model Tuning**: Applied grid search (GridSearchCV) to optimize the Logistic Regression model, tuning parameters like C and solver.
- **Benchmarking**: Compared optimized models against naive predictors and unoptimized versions.
- **Feature Importance**: Used models with feature_importances_ attribute, such as Random Forests, to determine the most important features influencing the prediction.
